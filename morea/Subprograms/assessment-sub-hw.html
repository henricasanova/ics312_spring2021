<ul>
<li> Many students are confused by registers, feeling that they should appear in C code. But in
     C we only have global variables (data segment) or local variables (stack).  Changing a 
     register value does nothing from the perspective of high-level code, until global or
     local variables are modified. Something like "mov EBX, [EBP+8]"  doesn't modify the data
     segment or the stack, and therefore does "nothing". If then one does "inc EBX", that still
     does "nothing". But now, if I do "mov [EBP-4], EBX" THEN I am setting a local variable
     to 1 plus the first parameter.

<li> Some mistakes seem to come from lack of C knowledge (no main() function???)

<li> Several mistakes were just about not following the C standard (i.e., arguments not in reversed order!)

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
