## Homework Assignment #0 [0 pts]

Several assignments in this course require that you a Linux platform. This
"assignment" guides you through the steps you need to follow to set up your
own Linux environment. Note that Having some experience with Linux is
crucial for your professional prospects. Almost every back-end system out
there runs Linux.  So if you're not familiar with Linux, don't think of
this "Linux for ICS312" as just something you have to do, but as a
_valuable experience_.

### I. Getting Access to a Linux platform

If you're already running Linux in one way or another, you can probably skip to the <a href="#nasm">Installing NASM section</a> below.  Otherwise, here are some options:

  - <a href="#option1">Option #1</a> Install Linux on your own system
  - <a href="#option2">Option #2</a> Install a terminal-only Linux Virtual Machine using Vagrant
  - <a href="#option3">Option #3</a> Install a Linux Virtual Machine using Virtual Box
  - <a href="#option4">Option #4</a> If you are using Windows 10, use WSL to run and install Ubuntu


Option #2 above is likely the easiest, as well as option #4 if you're running Windows 10.

#### Option #1: Run Linux on your own system

This is of course the slam dunk. Many of you are already running Linux and
can likely stop reading now. 
Running Linux on your own machine is of course the
ultimate way to gain experience, and most people get started with the ever
so popular <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu desktop
distribution</a>.

If you're not quite ready to replace your current OS with Linux, you can go
<i>dual boot</i> by installing a Linux partition on your machine.  This is
pretty standard, and there are many step-by-step guides on-line. A decent
one for setting up a dual-boot Windows/Linux machine is on the <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot">Ubuntu Web
site</a>. Ubuntu also provides a <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/windows-installer">Windows
installer</a>, which I've never tried myself but has been used successfully
by many people. See this page for <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation">MacOSX/Ubuntu</a>
dual boot. These links are active but may be stale. Web search engines are
your friends for figuring this out.

#### Option #2: Run Terminal-only Linux using Vagrant

<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> is a great tool that sits
on top of virtualization frameworks and allows for super quick installation
and usage. I use it on top of <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual
Box</a>, which is free. The <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html">Getting
Started</a> page on the Vagrant Web site is really good, but just in cases
here are a few easy steps:

  - <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Download an install Virtual Box</a> (but don't do any kind of VM setup... just install the software)
  - <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/">Download and install Vagrant</a>
  - Create a directory someplace convenient, say <tt>my_vagrant</tt>, and <tt>cd</tt> to that directory
  - In that directory, using whatever terminal on your system, type the command: <tt>vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64</tt>
    - If you're a Windows user, here is a likely <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/">helpful site about Vagrant and Windows</a>
  - Then type the command: <tt>vagrant up</tt>
  - After a few minutes, your VM is running, but you're not "in" it
  - To get a terminal to your VM: <tt>vagrant ssh</tt>, and voila, welcome to your Linux VM
  - Once you log out from the VM, you can shut it down with: <tt>vagrant halt</tt>

Try out the above to make sure everything works. This is the most basic use
of Vagrant. Your notice that once you've done all the above, you'll have a file called
<tt>VagrantFile</tt>, which you can customize later if you want. The Vagrant site has tons of good information about additional
capabilities and features.  Remember that you must always be in your <tt>my_vagrant</tt> directory.

<font color="red" size="+1"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> </font> A very useful feature
is that your <tt>my_vagrant</tt> directory on your host is mounted as
<tt>/vagrant/</tt> on your VM! So the files you keep there (i.e., your
programming assignments) are visible both on your host (e.g., for editing)
and on your VM (e.g., for compiling/running).  In addition,  if your VM may
become compromised, you can always re-install from scratch but you haven't
lost your files since they're always on your host!  Note that this is
<tt>/vagrant</tt> on the VM, that is a directory at the root (not, for
instance, <tt>/home/vagrant</tt>, which is your home directory on your VM.

So, for instance, say you have your homework assignment on your VM in your home directory,
and that it is in a directory called <tt>my_homework</tt>. This is how you would create
a <tt>.tar</tt> archive and copy it to your host (i.e., your own computer):

{%highlight text%}
% ls
my_homework/

% zip -r my_homework.zip my_homework

% cp my_homework.zip /vagrant
{%endhighlight%}

And now, on your computer, in the same directory in which you typed <tt>vagrant ssh</tt> you'll
see that file <tt>my_homework.tar</tt> has magically appeared.

#### Option #3: Run GUI-enabled Linux using Virtual Box

Vagrant above gives you very basic Terminal access, which is fast. However,
perhaps you want a full-features Ubuntu GUI, at the risk of it running
slowly on your system. In this case, you want to use Virtual Box (or
whatever Virtualization framework you want/have installed), and create and
start your VM that way. There are plenty of on-line documentation/tutorials on how to install
Ubuntu on VirtualBox. 
You should get the 17.04 Ubuntu
desktop distribution, which you can get from the <a
href="http://mirror.ancl.hawaii.edu/linux/ubuntu-releases/">UH mirror</a>
(e.g., download the file named <tt>ubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso</tt>.)  


<font color="red" size="+1"><b>IMPORTANT</b> </font> 

You absolutely want to set up a Shared
Folder (which works as the <tt>/vagrant/</tt> directory in Option #2). This
way, the files you keep there (i.e., your programming assignments) are
visible both on your host (e.g., for editing) and on your VM (e.g., for
compiling/running).  In addition,  if your VM may become compromised, you
can always re-install from scratch but you haven't lost your files since
they're always on your host!

<font color="red" size="+1"><b>END IMPORTANT</b> </font>

#### Option #4: Run Ubuntu via WSL on Windows 10


**WSL2** supports 32-bit binaries. See these two links.
  - [WSL2 vs. WSL1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions)
  - [WSL2 description, which mentions 32-bit binaries](https://medium.com/@vishwa1234567891/windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2-0-f95d6f0b932)

So, as long as you have the latest Windows and have WLS2, you should be all good, and proceed to Step II below.

### II. Installing NASM

Now that you have access to a Linux machine, you need to install NASM. 
Assuming you're running Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu package
manager tool with a GUI. However, I typically use only the command-line (you'll find that's a theme throughout the semester) to install packages.
<p>
First, 
 make sure you are connected to the network. Then 
open a Terminal window and type the following command:

{% highlight text %}
sudo apt update
{% endhighlight %}

The <tt>sudo</tt> command runs commands as the super user, and when you
installed Ubuntu you were placed by default in the list of users who can
use <tt>sudo</tt>. The <tt>apt</tt> command is used to deal with
everything related to package management, and in the invocation above, to
update your package list so that you will not have errors installing new
packages.  This could take a while. 

Once the package list has been
updated, then install nasm by typing the following command:

{% highlight text %}
sudo apt install gcc make nasm gcc-multilib
{% endhighlight %}

This last package is to make sure that you can generate 32-bit
executables with the gcc C compiler.

That's it!

<h3>III. Checking that NASM works</h3>

I've built a small test case, which is in fact the basic framework we'll be
using throughout the semester, so that you can check that everything's
working.  Download the <a href="./nasm_check.tar">nasm_check.tar</a>
archive to your account on your Linux box, e.g., in your home
directory. This can be done in many ways, for instance from a Web browser that you're running in your Ubuntu installation. The easiest way may be to
type in a terminal the command (on one line):

{% highlight text %}
wget http://henricasanova.github.io/ics312_spring2021/morea/GettingStarted/nasm_check.tar
{% endhighlight %}

(If you get a "<tt>wget: command not found</tt>" error, simply install <tt>wget</tt> by typing the command "<tt>sudo apt install wget</tt>")
<p>

Once the archive is in your working directory, you can unarchive it by typing the command:

{% highlight text %}
tar -xvf nasm_check.tar
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a directory named <tt>nasm_check</tt>. 
Go to that directory:

{% highlight text %}
cd  nasm_check
{% endhighlight %}

and type the command:

{% highlight text %}
make
{% endhighlight %}

You should get some output, and the last line should be: "It works!". If
not, then you should send me an e-mail with the whole output.  If you get
the correct output, you now have everything that you need for all NASM
assignments.

If you see some "Command not found" message,you can likely install the required software with <tt>sudo apt install ...</tt> as explained in the error message.

If you see some errors like "skipping incompatible ...", you may have to install two new packages:

{% highlight text %}
sudo apt install lib32gcc-9-dev libx32gcc-9-dev
{% endhighlight text %}

If this fails, contact your TA/instructor.
